Hospital Management System - Summary
This project aims to create a digital system for hospitals to manage patient records, appointments, lab results, and diagnoses efficiently. The system will store and organize data, ensuring accessibility for hospital staff and administrators.

Key Features:
- Automated Patient ID Assignment – Each registered patient receives a unique identifier.
- Staff & Patient Data Management – The system maintains records for both patients and hospital personnel.
- Search Functionality – A built-in search feature will help locate specific records in large datasets.
- Database Storage – The system can use either local storage or cloud-based databases for data management.
- Flexible Front-end Options – It can be developed as a Windows-based, console-based, or web-based application.
- Back-end Requirements – Only relational databases like SQLite or MySQL are allowed; NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB) are not permitted.

The project challenges to choose between local and cloud databases while ensuring efficiency, security, and ease of use.
